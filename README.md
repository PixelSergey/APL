# APL Problem Solving Competition

My submissions for the yearly [APL Problem Solving Competition](https://contest.dyalog.com/).
Developed using Dyalog APL.

## Installation and execution

The easiest way to run this code is by using Dyalog's `dyalogscript` feature.
I could only get this to work on Linux and WSL; running on Windows is a little more difficult.

Instructions:
1. Download and install [Dyalog](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm) for Linux
2. Run `dyalogscript <filename>.apl` or `./<filename>.apl` to execute the APL code

You can also copy and paste the Part 1 solutions to [Try APL](https://tryapl.org/) and interact with them live.
For Part 2 solutions, a local IDE or Dyalog APL development environment is recommended.
